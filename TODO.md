* inst and synth forms should evalute the defaults rather than expecting them to
be numbers (to use equations, constant vars, etc...)

## Helpers

* rather than using a plain multiply for volume adjustment, we should have 
a built-in helper that uses dbamp and multiply to adjust volume logarithmically,
corresponding to perception.
 - use a range of 0 - 1.0, so it works automatically with GUI controls and other
   ugens.

## Studio

* route all synths and samplers to a main mixer bus, providing panning, EQ, and
volume controls.
  - figure out how FX should work into this

* have a mechanism to route sound to a preview channel for listening to
something in headphones to try it out.

* create a basic EQ that can be used on any track

* basic record functionality for root group
 - Sam's disk-out examples

* create a basic volume and pan control node that can be used for the master
volume and per synth-track control

* implementing some basic midi mapping

* fill out metronome functionality

* hook up the sequencer

* implement a portamento helper on top of slew

## General

* create a function that prints out the currently running synths
 - maybe use node-tree + info from the synth-groups

* view a table or tree of running synths with the ability to kill and maybe
modify control params

* allow for re-arranging nodes and groups using a tree/table view

* figure out how best to attach meta-data to the [unary,binary]-op-ugen

## Synths and Audio:

* make midi->hz and friends multimethods (or use types and protocols?) so they
operate immediately on numbers, but generate ugens on input proxy or ugen
arguments.

* add docs to Unary and Binary op ugens 

* add another argument mode to ugens so that buffers and samples can be passed
to ugens as arguments and their :id property will be used 
  - get rid of UGen wrapper function currently doing this for all ugens

* implement the rest of the argument modes for ugens, as described in
  docs/dev/core/ugen_definition.mdml.
 (currently there is just :append-seq)
