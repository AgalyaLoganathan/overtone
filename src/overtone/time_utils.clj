; Time

; NOTES:
; System "time of day" clock => ms since the epoch (00:00 of Jan. 1, 1970)
; Accurate to the OS clock interrupt interval, which is typically about 10ms.
;(System/currentTimeMillis)

; Uses the highest resolution timer available, returning a free-running count
; in nanoseconds, although resolution is typically on the order of microseconds.
; Only valid when compared with other nanoTime values, so used for event timing.
;(System/nanoTime)
;
; Apparently there is also this un-documented class, which uses the CPU counter
; directly, and it's available on all Sun JVM supported platforms.
;
; (def perf (sun.misc.Perf/getPerf))
;
; resolution in ticks per second
; (.highResFrequency perf) => 1000000 (mhz) on my laptop
;
; current number of ticks since start of this JVM
; (.highResCounter perf)
;
; The ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor is supposed to use the best available clock,
; so that's where we'll start.  Eventually we should try with the real-time JVM if
; it seems that timing isn't accurate enough.
